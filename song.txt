Across a painted desert lies a train of vagabonds
All that's left of what we were it's what we have become
Once our empires glorious, but now the empire's gone
The dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done

Now we are victorious, we've become our slaves
A land of hope and glory building graveyards for the brave

Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding?

Holding onto fury is that all we ever know
Ignorance our judge and jury, all we've got to show
From Hollywood to Babylon, holy war to kingdom come
On a trail of dust and ashes when the burning sky is done
